    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Membership Programs and Credit Cards</h2>
      <p>
        When you join a loyalty program – airline, hotel, or other ecosystem – you receive a member ID and start at a basic tier.
        A linked credit card can turn your everyday spending into progress within that membership: more points, more qualifying
        nights, or more status-earning segments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some cards are co-branded with a single program, while others earn flexible bank points that can later be transferred into
        different memberships. In both cases, the card sits between your everyday payments and the loyalty system’s internal
        status rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Status & tiers -->
    <section id="status" class="section">
      <h2>How Cards Help You Earn or Keep Status</h2>
      <p>
        Membership status is usually based on activity: flights, nights, spend or a mix. Credit cards can influence this in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bonus points or miles</strong> for purchases in specific categories or with partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Qualifying spend</strong> that counts towards status thresholds in your program.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual “elite night” or “tier point” boosts</strong> just for holding the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Shortcut offers</strong>, such as reduced requirements for members with a premium card.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not all points are equal: some are <em>redeemable</em> (for flights or nights), while others are <em>qualifying</em> (for status only).
        It’s important to check which type your card actually earns.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Perks -->
    <section id="perks" class="section">
      <h2>Member-Only Perks Linked to Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Membership benefits can be unlocked either by reaching a tier, by holding a certain card, or by combining the two.
        Typical perks include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Priority check-in, boarding or customer service queues.</li>
        <li>Extra baggage allowance or preferred seating.</li>
        <li>Hotel upgrades, late check-out and welcome amenities.</li>
        <li>Discounts or bonus points on partner purchases.</li>
        <li>Dedicated phone lines or chat support for higher tiers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A card might guarantee a certain minimum tier while you hold it, or simply help you climb the ladder faster.
        Understanding this distinction can prevent disappointment when offers change or when a card is cancelled.
