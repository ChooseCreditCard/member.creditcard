        Member.creditcard looks at cards issued in partnership with unions, clubs, associations,
        charities and other member organisations – how they are structured, who earns what, and how
        to judge if the card really supports the community it promotes.

    <!-- What is a member / affinity card? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What is a member or affinity credit card?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        A member or affinity credit card is a card issued in cooperation between a bank or issuer and
        an organisation with members or supporters. The card carries the organisation’s name or logo and
        often promises tailored benefits or a contribution back to the organisation when you use it.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Unions and professional associations with member-focused benefits.</li>
        <li>Charities and NGOs where a share of spend supports the cause.</li>
        <li>Clubs and communities – sports, culture, alumni, local groups.</li>
        <li>Online communities or platforms with engaged, recurring members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        On the surface, it looks like “your organisation’s card”. In reality, it is a partnership:
        the issuer handles regulation and lending, while the organisation handles brand and distribution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How membership card programs work</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Under the hood, most member card programs follow a similar pattern:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Issuer agreement</strong> – the organisation signs an agreement with an issuer that
          defines fees, rewards, risk and revenue share.</li>
        <li><strong>Branding &amp; positioning</strong> – card design, name and messaging are aligned
          with the organisation’s identity and values.</li>
        <li><strong>Member targeting</strong> – existing members are invited during onboarding, via
          newsletters, events or digital channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Reward &amp; support structure</strong> – points, cashback or donations are tied to
          card use, sometimes with extra benefits for active members.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing reporting</strong> – the organisation receives performance, revenue-share
          and sometimes anonymised spend insights.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Some programs are genuinely aligned with member interests. Others are more about marketing than
        value. Understanding the structure makes it easier to tell the difference.
      </p>

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common types of member & affinity card models</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Member card programs can take many forms. Here are some of the most common models you will see:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Union &amp; association cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards issued via labour unions, trade associations or professional bodies. Often focused
            on insurance, legal help, fee discounts and negotiated benefits for members.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Charity &amp; cause cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            A small percentage of spend or a fixed fee is donated to a specific charity or cause.
            Transparency on how much actually flows through is critical.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Club &amp; community cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Sports clubs, cultural organisations, alumni networks and local communities offering
            cards with branded designs and perks for events, merchandise or tickets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Member-only premium tiers</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards only available to paying members of a service or platform. Benefits can include
            boosted rewards, status, partner discounts or exclusive experiences.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Multi-partner ecosystems</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Member cards that plug into a larger partner ecosystem – lounges, insurance, retail
            offers and travel partners – beyond the original organisation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Digital-first &amp; embedded cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards embedded in a membership app, using virtual cards, instant issuance and integrated
            loyalty – common in modern fintech and subscription platforms.
          </p>
